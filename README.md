# Express.js API

## Authentication & Authorisation (JWT Token)
I have implemented JWT (Json Web Token) based authentication & authorisation in Express.js while integrating it with a database(MongoDB) for storing user data.

We will send requests through postman to test the API and I have attached the screenshots of the same!
